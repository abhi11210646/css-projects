                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, better known as APJ Abdul Kalam, was born on 15 October 1931,
                    in
                    Rameswaram (Tamil Nadu) into a poor family. His father was a boatman and young Kalam went to work
                    very
                    early. His compelling love for education, however, led the young man to work very hard and develop a
                    strong sense of discipline. He studied Physics and graduated from the University of Madras in 1954.
                    Kalam’s first love, though, was aerospace engineering which he pursued from Madras Institute of
                    Technology. Having narrowly missed being recruited as an Air Force pilot, Kalam got to work on
                    designing
                    military helicopters in the employ of the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation).
                </p>
                <p>
                    His humble origins imparted Dr. Kalam a great appreciation of the state in which the majority of the
                    country’s population exists. His characteristic humility and the great emphasis he laid on education
                    and
                    the development of youth came from these early experiences.

                    <li>
                        After completing his graduation in 1960, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam joined as a scientist in Defence
                        Research and Development Organisation’s Aeronautical Development Establishment.

                    <li>
                        At the very start of his career, he designed a small helicopter for the Indian army.
                    </li>
                    <li>He also worked under the renowned scientist Vikram Sarabhai as a part of the committee of
                        INCOSPAR.</li>
                    <li>From 1963 to 1964, he visited the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the
                        Wallops Flight Facility located at the Eastern Shore of Virginia and the Langley Research Center
                        of NASA situated at Hampton, Virginia.</li>
                    <li>In 1965, he worked independently in Defence Research and Development Organisation for the first
                        time on an expandable rocket project. The programme was expanded in 1969 and more engineers were
                        included after receiving Government approval.</li>
                    <li>He became the Project Director of India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III)
                        when he was transferred in 1969 to Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). In July 1980, his
                        team was successful in deploying the Rohini satellite near the orbit of the Earth.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam’s efforts in developing the projects on SLV-III and Polar SLV from 1970s to 1990s
                        proved to be successful.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam and Dr. V.S. Arunachalam, on the proposal of the then Defense Minister R.
                        Venkataraman, worked on developing a quiver of missiles instead of one at a time. Dr. Kalam was
                        made the Chief Executive of the programme, which was named Integrated Guided Missile Development
                        programme.</li>
                    <li>From July 1992 to December 1999 he remained the Secretary of the Defence Research and
                        Development Organisation, and also the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister. This
                        period witnessed the Pokhran II nuclear tests, when Dr. Kalam played a key technological and
                        political role. At the time of the testing phase, he, along with R. Chidambaram, was made the
                        Chief Project Coordinator.</li>
                    <li>He developed a low-cost Coronary Stent along with Dr. Soma Raju, a cardiologist, in 1998. It was
                        named “Kalam-Raju Stent” after them. Both of them also designed a tablet PC called “Kalam-Raju
                        Tablet” for healthcare in rural areas.</li>
